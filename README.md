# bin

My collection of user-defined commands. Maybe someday they'll end up as
full-fledged projects with their own repositories and registered with package
managers, but for now they're here.

Unless you read a blog post about a script in here, you can safely assume that
the either the script has _no documentation_ or might even be broken. Take away
from that what you will.
